 * jchrest.lib.Square} in a {@link jchrest.lib.Scene}.
 * 
 * A {@link jchrest.domainSpecifics.Fixation} has two time variables.  The first 
 * denotes when the {@link jchrest.lib.Square} that is to be focused on by a 
 * {@link jchrest.architecture.Perceiver} associated with a {@link 
 * jchrest.architecture.Chrest} model has been selected (time decided upon).  
 * The second denotes the time that {@link #this} is to be performed, i.e. the
 * time that the {@link jchrest.architecture.Perceiver} associated with a {@link 
 * jchrest.architecture.Chrest} model actually focuses on the {@link 
 * jchrest.lib.Square} selected.  These times can vary from one type of {@link 
 * jchrest.domainSpecifics.Fixation} to another and so should be set 
 * accordingly.
 * 
 * A {@link jchrest.domainSpecifics.Fixation} also stores the {@link 
 * jchrest.lib.Scene} that {@link #this} was performed in context of, the x and 
 * y coordinates of the {@link jchrest.lib.Square} fixated on in the {@link 
 * jchrest.lib.Scene} and the {@link jchrest.lib.SceneObject} present on the 
 * {@link jchrest.lib.Square} fixated on. The instance variables of {@link 
 * #this} that store this information should only be set when {@link #this} is 
 * actually performed. By default, these instance variables are all set to 
 * {@code null}.
